INSTRUCTIONS
------------
Knock out enemies using melee attacks or blowdarts. You have a limited number of blowdarts.
Then, either eat them with spacebar or drag them to any foliage (including the red flower).
After eating an enemy, you have to wait a while until you're hungry again.
Be careful -- if you are spotted, enemies will either shoot at you or escape to the nearest boat/cabin.
If any enemies escape, or if you get shot, you lose!
And of course, collect as many paper clips as you can. Praise be until Lord Clippy.
